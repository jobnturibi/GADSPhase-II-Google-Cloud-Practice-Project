#LAB: Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with App Engine
#Objectives
#In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:
#Initialize App Engine.
#Preview an App Engine application running locally in Cloud Shell.
#Deploy an App Engine application, so that others can reach it.
#Disable an App Engine application, when you no longer want it to be visible.
#Set up your lab environment

#list the active account name
gcloud auth list

#list the project ID
gcloud config list project

#Initialize your App Engine app with your project and choose its region
gcloud app create --project=$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID

#Clone the source code repository for a sample application in the hello_world directory:
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples

#Navigate to the source directory:
cd python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world

# download and update the packages list
sudo apt-get update

#Set up a virtual environment in which you will run your application.
sudo apt-get install virtualenv
virtualenv -p python3 venv

#Activate the virtual environment.
source venv/bin/activate

#Navigate to your project directory and install dependencies.
pip install  -r requirements.txt

#Run the application:
python main.py

#Navigate to the source directory:
cd ~/python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world

#Deploy your Hello World application.
gcloud app deploy

#Launch your browser to view the app at http://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com
gcloud app browse
